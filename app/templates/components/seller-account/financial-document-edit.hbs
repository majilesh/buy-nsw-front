<p class="b">At the time a buyer requests your financial statements, we will verify with you the records we hold are complete, accurate and up-to-date.</p>
<h4>What to provide</h4>
<p>Up-to-date financial statements help buyers to determine the financial stability of your organisation so that they can make an informed decision. These documents are required before a buyer is able to engage your business.</p>
<p>Financial statements provide detailed information about the financial performance and position of your organisation. Ideally your financial statement should include your:</p>
<ul>
  <li>profit or loss statement </li>
  <li>balance sheet </li>
  <li>statement of cash flows </li>
  <li>statement of changes in equity </li>
  <li>and notes to the financial statements. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are unable to share the documents listed above, you can also ask your external accountant for a letter confirming your business can meet it's debts when they are due and doesn't have any issues that could impact your ability to deliver your products or services.</p>
