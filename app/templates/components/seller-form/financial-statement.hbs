  <b>What to provide</b>
</p>
<p>
  Up-to-date financial statements help buyers to determine the financial stability of your organisation so that they can make an informed decision. These documents are required before a buyer is able to engage your business.
</p>
<p>
  Financial statements provide detailed information about the financial performance and position of your organisation. Ideally your financial statement should include your:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>  profit or loss statement </li>
    <li>	balance sheet </li>
    <li>	statement of cash flows </li>
    <li>	statement of changes in equity </li>
    <li>	and notes to the financial statements. </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  If you are unable to share the documents listed above, you can also ask your external accountant for a letter confirming your business can meet its debts when they're due and doesn't have any issues that could impact your ability to deliver your products or services.
